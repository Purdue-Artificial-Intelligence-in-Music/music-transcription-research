    ** CATEGORY: BOTH **
    --> Models are both statistically and practically different

  SUMMARY FOR RECALL:
    Both significant: 33/36 (91.7%)

PRACTICAL vs STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE SUMMARY
============================================================

Metric          | Both | Stat Only | Pract Only | Neither
-------------------------------------------------------
f_measure       |   33 |         1 |          0 |       2
precision       |   33 |         2 |          0 |       1
recall          |   33 |         2 |          0 |       1

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
- 'Both Significant': Models are meaningfully different (trust this)
- 'Statistical Only': Models are similar in practice (your visual observation is correct)
- 'Practical Only': Large differences but high variance (investigate further)
- 'Neither': Models perform very similarly

MULTIPLE COMPARISON CORRECTION COMPARISON
============================================================
Number of comparisons: 36
Original alpha level: 0.05

  BONFERRONI: 34/36 significant (corrected α = 0.0014)
        HOLM: 34/36 significant (corrected α = 0.0014)
      FDR_BH: 34/36 significant (corrected α = 0.0014)
      FDR_BY: 34/36 significant (corrected α = 0.0014)
        NONE: 34/36 significant (no correction)

RECOMMENDATION:
- Use FDR_BH (Benjamini-Hochberg) for exploratory analysis
- Use HOLM for confirmatory analysis (less conservative than Bonferroni)
- BONFERRONI is very conservative - use only if you need maximum protection against Type I errors

FOR YOUR RESEARCH:
- If you're doing EXPLORATORY analysis: Use FDR_BH (controls false discovery rate)
- If you're doing CONFIRMATORY analysis: Use HOLM (step-down method, less conservative)
- If you need MAXIMUM protection: Use BONFERRONI (most conservative)
