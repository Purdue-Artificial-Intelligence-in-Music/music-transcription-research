INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
- 'Both Significant': Models are meaningfully different (trust this)
- 'Statistical Only': Models are similar in practice (your visual observation is correct)
- 'Practical Only': Large differences but high variance (investigate further)
- 'Neither': Models perform very similarly

MULTIPLE COMPARISON CORRECTION COMPARISON
============================================================
Number of comparisons: 45
Original alpha level: 0.05

  BONFERRONI: 43/45 significant (corrected α = 0.0011)
        HOLM: 43/45 significant (corrected α = 0.0011)
      FDR_BH: 43/45 significant (corrected α = 0.0011)
      FDR_BY: 43/45 significant (corrected α = 0.0011)
        NONE: 43/45 significant (no correction)

RECOMMENDATION:
- Use FDR_BH (Benjamini-Hochberg) for exploratory analysis
- Use HOLM for confirmatory analysis (less conservative than Bonferroni)
- BONFERRONI is very conservative - use only if you need maximum protection against Type I errors

FOR YOUR RESEARCH:
- If you're doing EXPLORATORY analysis: Use FDR_BH (controls false discovery rate)
- If you're doing CONFIRMATORY analysis: Use HOLM (step-down method, less conservative)
- If you need MAXIMUM protection: Use BONFERRONI (most conservative)
